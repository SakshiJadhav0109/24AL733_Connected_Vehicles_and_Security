### Problem Statement

The integration of 5G technology into Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication is revolutionizing the landscape of connected and automated mobility. Traditional systems, such as Dedicated Short-Range Communication (DSRC) and LTE-based networks, have struggled with limitations in scalability, latency, and security, which hinder their ability to meet the growing demands of modern V2X applications. As vehicular networks become more data-intensive and time-sensitive, these systems fail to provide the required efficiency, particularly in high-density urban environments where communication channels are easily congested. 5G addresses these challenges with its advanced capabilities, offering low-latency, high-bandwidth, and highly reliable communication solutions that enable seamless data exchange and support real-time decision-making in critical scenarios.
