### Problem Statement
The increased connectivity in vehicles through different communication protocols like CAN, Ethernet, LIN, FlexRay, MOST introduces different cyber security attacks and raises concern regarding safety and security concerns.
1.	Physical Attacks: Attackers connect to the vehicle On-Board Diagnostics (OBD-II) port to gain access to the CAN bus. Tampering with Internal Wiring.
2.	Spoofing Attacks: Injecting fabricated messages to control various vehicle functions.
3.	Frame Fuzzification: Sending any random CAN messages to cause unpredictable vehicle behavior.
4.	Denial-of-Service (DoS) Attacks: Transmitting a large volume of messages, which may result in unexpected vehicle system behavior.
5.	Remote Attacks via Infotainment Systems: Attacking USB ports, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.
6.	Malware Injection: Malicious software can be introduced through USB drives, SD cards, or OTA updates.<br>

Due to these all kinds of vulnerabilities, it is essential to implement IDS/IPS which will detect and prevent known and unknown attacks.

### Literature Survey
The first paper[1], have used a lightweight multi-stage Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for in-vehicle networks using deep learning. It employs an artificial neural network (ANN) for known attacks and an LSTM-autoencoder for unknown threats. The system has integrated hierarchical federated learning for privacy and achieving high accuracy and low false alarm rates.<br>
In paper[2], discussed different IDPS methodology mostly focused on hybrid detection system using anomoly-based and signature-based detection mechanism. It also introduces SNORT which is a free open source intrusion detection system. It is one of the Signature based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System.<br>
In paper[3], analyzes intrusion detection systems (IDS) for automotive Ethernet networks, challenges, methodologies, and solutions for securing in-vehicle communications. It highlights the importance of using IDS against cyberattacks, compares existing IDS architectures, and proposes future research directions, including blockchain, machine learning, and edge computing for enhanced security and scalability.<br>
In paper[4], It proposes an embedded intrusion detection system (IDS) for connected vehicles using a two-step algorithm. It analyzes CAN-Bus traffic with spatial-temporal methods and Bayesian networks to identify attacks like DoS and Frame Fuzzification. Experiments analyzes strong accuracy, highlighting its potential to enhance cybersecurity in modern automotive networks.

### Proposed Work
The proposed Intrusion Detection System (IDS) employs a hybrid, multi-stage approach to detect cyber threats within in-vehicle networks. The hybrid IDS integrates both signature-based and anomaly-based detection methodologies.
1.	Signature-Based Intrusion Detection System:<br>
- Monitoring all packets within the network.<br>
- Detect known attacks based on previous data.
2.	Anomaly-Based Intrusion Detection System:<br>
-	Monitors network behaviors such as bandwidth usage, device activity, port usage, and protocol communications.<br>
-	Identifies anomalous unknown threats.<br>
Targeted Networks: CAN, Ethernet
