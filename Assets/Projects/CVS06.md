### Problem Statement
Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) and broader vehicular communication systems face growing cybersecurity challenges, including risks such as denial-of-service attacks, message tampering, and identity spoofing, which compromise system reliability and user privacy. Current security measures are often insufficient to address the evolving nature of these threats and the increasing complexity of connected and autonomous vehicle networks. With advancements in technologies like quantum computing threatening traditional cryptographic approaches, there is a critical need for scalable and future-proof security frameworks that ensure secure, efficient, and privacy-preserving communication in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS)

### Literature Survey

Cybersecurity Attacks in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) Applications and Their Prevention[1]
This paper addresses the critical vulnerabilities in V2I communication systems, such as Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, impersonation, and message alteration, which can disrupt traffic management and safety-critical applications. The study highlights the inadequacy of existing V2I security architectures in mitigating these threats effectively. To address these challenges, the authors propose CVGuard, a novel security architecture combining Edge Computing, Software-Defined Networking (SDN), and Network Functions Virtualization (NFV). CVGuard leverages microboxes at RSUs to monitor data, detect anomalies, and mitigate attacks in real time. The architecture employs a centralized controller for threat analysis and coordination, enabling scalable and flexible protection against a wide range of cyber threats. A case study focusing on a DDoS attack on the Stop Sign Gap Assist (SSGA) application demonstrates CVGuard's effectiveness, reducing vehicle conflicts by 60%. This study emphasizes the importance of integrating emerging technologies to enhance the resilience of V2I systems.<br>Evaluation of Attack Vectors and Risks in Automobiles and Road Infrastructure[2] This paper examines the increasing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in connected and autonomous vehicles and their interaction with road infrastructure. It identifies key problems such as vulnerabilities in the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus, keyless entry systems, and road infrastructure components like smart traffic signs. These systems are susceptible to attacks, including man-in-the-middle, message spoofing, and denial-of-service (DoS), which can compromise vehicle functionality and road safety. To mitigate these risks, the authors recommend implementing secure sensor designs, encryption protocols, and robust authentication mechanisms. Additionally, they emphasize the need for industry-wide collaboration and the adoption of bug bounty programs to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities. The study underscores the importance of securing not just the vehicles but the entire ecosystem of connected infrastructure to ensure overall safety and reliability.<br>
Security Threats in Intelligent Transportation Systems and Their Risk Levels[3] This paper focuses on identifying and evaluating the security threats facing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) using a Threat, Vulnerability, and Risk Analysis (TVRA) framework. The authors address critical threats such as Sybil attacks, impersonation, jamming, and malware propagation, which jeopardize the reliability of ITS. They propose several countermeasures, including encryption, pseudonymous authentication, and digital signatures to ensure data confidentiality and authentication. The study also highlights the potential of blockchain-based routing protocols for ensuring secure communication in ITS. Emerging techniques such as machine learning and reinforcement learning are recommended for real-time threat detection and mitigation. The authors conclude that a multi-layered security framework is essential for protecting ITS against these threats and ensuring safe and efficient transportation networks.<br> Quantum Key Distribution for V2I Communications with Software-Defined Networking[4]
The paper focuses on the increasing vulnerabilities of Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication systems to cyber threats, including quantum-based attacks that can compromise traditional cryptographic systems. With sensitive data like real-time traffic information being exchanged in V2I networks, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and resilience of these communications is paramount. Existing cryptographic techniques are inadequate for securing such systems in the post-quantum era.The paper integrates Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to provide secure and scalable V2I communications. QKD ensures information-theoretic security using Free-Space Optical (FSO) technology, while SDN optimizes resource allocation and key management.<br>A Practical Implementation of Quantum-Derived Keys for Secure Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Communications[5]
This paper highlights the limitations of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) in securing real-time, safety-critical applications in V2I systems. PKI-based methods are vulnerable to attacks, particularly in the context of future quantum computers, which could easily break current cryptographic protocols. The lack of practical implementations for post-quantum secure V2I communication frameworks is a significant gap. The study implements FSO-QKD to generate quantum-secure encryption keys for V2I systems. It introduces a Zero-Trust Security Protocol (ZAP) to prevent spoofed messages and validates its effectiveness against attack scenarios.<br>
A Privacy Preserving Authentication Protocol Using Quantum Computing for V2I Authentication in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks[6]
This paper addresses the dual challenges of ensuring both privacy and security in Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs). Traditional cryptographic techniques rely on computationally hard problems, which are susceptible to quantum attacks. The need for an authentication protocol that protects against generic and quantum-specific threats while preserving user privacy is a key focus of this study. The paper proposes a QKD-based authentication protocol combined with Classical Identity-Based Authentication to ensure privacy, message unlinkability, and vehicle traceability. Simulations confirm its robustness against quantum attacks and practical applicability.

### Proposed Work

The proposed work aims to design a Quantum Machine Learning (QML)-based anomaly detection framework for addressing cybersecurity threats in Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication.

Traditional detection methods often lack scalability and efficiency, particularly in real-time scenarios. By leveraging QML algorithms, the proposed framework will enable faster and more accurate threat detection by analyzing vehicular communication patterns.
